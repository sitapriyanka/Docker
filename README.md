Challeges in understanding COPY and docker build

Docker can only copy files from the context. and Context is the input directory we send to docker build command.

The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile and a context. The buildâ€™s context is the files at a specified location PATH. The PATH is a directory on your local filesystem.
